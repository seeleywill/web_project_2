# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Some potential additions include a differently-colored border for the active input window on the form section, and a visual confirmation that a form was submitted. There could also be links to return to the header in the other sections of the page. Certain hover states could also be more visually distinct from their default appearance, such as a greater change in color, animated change in scale, or an animated drop shadow.
